        <h2>What I Offer:</h2>
        <p>
          Tutoring sessions are tailored to meet each student's unique needs, but they all begin with the same approach. After an initial consultation where we discuss the student's goals and review their practice exam results, I’ll create a personalized study plan that targets both strengths and areas for improvement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sessions typically last 1-1.5 hours long where I work with the students. The student and I work together to come up with appropriate homework levels and I provide all the study materials. If the student already has study materials I can adapt homework and practice questions to make better use of study materials already owned if I see them up-to-date and the appropriate difficulty level.
        </p>
        <h2>Remote and In-Person Sessions:</h2>
        <p>
          I’ve been exclusively teaching remotely for the past few years, working with students from around the world, and am comfortable with an online classroom set-up. However, if you prefer in-person sessions, I am available for tutoring in the Nairobi area, whether in your home, my home, or at a local coffee shop.
        </p>
