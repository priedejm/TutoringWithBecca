          Hi there! My name is Becca and I am originally from North Carolina in the U.S. I have a Bachelor’s degree in International Relations from Pepperdine University and a Master’s in Development Economics from Université Paris-Est Créteil. With over 5 years of SAT tutoring experience, I’ve had the privilege of supporting more than 300 students throughout their college preparation journey.

        <p id="about-experience">
          Specializing in all subjects of the SAT and having designed customized curricula for the evolving digital format, I understand the exam inside and out. Whether students are aiming for top-tier scores or just looking to improve, I approach each student the same in identifying strengths and weaknesses and working together to come up with a plan and goal. I have worked with students from all over with many different backgrounds and am able to adapt to different learning styles and educational backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p id="about-approach">
          Standardized testing can be daunting without knowing what to expect, but it becomes more manageable with the right guidance. As your SAT tutor, I ensure you walk into exam day confident, fully prepared, and knowing exactly what to expect, making your goals more achievable.
        </p>
        <p id="about-strategies">
          I focus on providing targeted strategies that students can apply both on test day and in their academic journey beyond.
