          <p>
            I would highly recommend Becca as an SAT tutor. Her teaching style is engaging and incredibly effective, making complex topics easy to understand. She tailored lessons to my specific weaknesses, which helped me improve my score significantly—from 1080 on my practice test to 1270 on the actual SAT. Becca’s encouragement and structured approach made the whole process less overwhelming, and I’m really grateful for her guidance.

          <h2>Morgan from Florida improved 180 points!</h2>
          <p>
            My mother and I decided to get a sat tutor at the last minute. Becca improved my score by 180 points in total from the time we started. Having ADHD made it hard for me to focus and pay attention, but Becca surprised me. What made her stand out was her willingness to work with my attention span and keep me engaged; her patience was unmatched. I went from failing in some categories on the sat to achieving perfect scores, I never thought it would be possible. Becca was very helpful and understanding of me, she really did help me and I am grateful my mother and I found her.

She knows all types of approaches that will help you organize your time better and focus on the essentials for perfectly solving the different questions. She gives helpful tips and has a huge number of practice exams for you to train. I strongly believe that I wouldn't have improved so fast without Becca's help and positive attitude.
